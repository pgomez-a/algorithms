An **algorithm** is a process or set of rules that must be followed in calculations or other troubleshooting operations, especially by a computer. As programmers, most of the time we need to use some algorithms to improve our programs and make them better and more efficient.<br>
I have decided to make a notebook with some of the most useful algorithms you might need for your programs, so you don't need to break your head to find an optimized solution for your code. Feel free to use, manipulate, and do whatever you want with this repository. If you find any errors or want to improve it, <a href="https://github.com/pgomez-a">please do not hesitate to contact me.</a><br>

### Algorithm Analysis
In Computer Science, **_algorithm analysis is about finding and studying their complexity_** (amount of time, storage, resources, etc. that are needed for their execution time). Typically this involves using a function that relates the length of the input to the number of steps the algorithm needs to run (temporal complexity) or the memory storage it requires (spatial complexity). The algorithm is said to be efficient if the function returns low outputs or if they grow slowly compared to the growth of the input values. However, different inputs have different outputs, so it's a good idea to consider best-case, worst-case, and average-case.<br>
<br>
Algorithm analysis is part of a broad theory of computational complexity, which provides theoretical estimates of the resources an algorithm needs to solve a computational problem. When doing a theoretical analysis of algorithms, it is normal to use an asymptotic sense to study the complexity function related to large inputs. To this end, we use **notations**.

### Binary Search
Also know as <b>half-interval search</b>, is a <b>search</b> algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.<br>

### Selection Sort
This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimun element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.<br>
